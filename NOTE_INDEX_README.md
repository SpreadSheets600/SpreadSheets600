# Discord Bot Note Index Pagination

This repository contains a Discord bot with improved note index functionality featuring pagination and better user experience.

## 🔧 Problem Solved

The original note index command had several issues:
- Showed too much information in a single embed (cluttered UI)
- Limited to 10 notes with no way to see more
- No pagination controls
- Overwhelming amount of details per note

## ✨ Improvements Implemented

### 🟢 New Paginated Note Index (`!notes_new`)

- **Pagination System**: Navigate through notes with Previous/Next buttons
- **Essential Information Only**: Shows title, subject, date, and uploader
- **Configurable Page Size**: 5-10 notes per page (default: 7)
- **Page Indicators**: Shows "Page X of Y" and total note count
- **Smart Button States**: Disables Previous on first page, Next on last page
- **Clean Design**: Simplified, readable embed layout
- **Scalable**: Handles any number of notes efficiently

### 🔴 Original Command (`!notes`) - For Comparison

- Shows all note details including content, tags, file size, downloads
- Limited to first 10 notes only
- Single large embed that becomes cluttered
- No navigation controls

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test the Bot Code**:
   ```bash
   python test_bot.py
   ```

3. **Run the Bot** (requires Discord bot token):
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
