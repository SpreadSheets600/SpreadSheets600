            <h3>Fallen SMP</h3>
            <p>
              This is a unique Minecraft SMP that I’ve been dedicated to making
              one-of-a-kind. Not only did I design and develop the website, but
              I also created a custom Discord bot that seamlessly connects the
              Minecraft server with the Discord community. The bot offers a
              variety of advanced features, including an in-game economy, stock
              and cryptocurrency tracking, detailed player statistics, and an
              innovative whitelisting system for exclusive access to the SMP.
              Every aspect of this project is crafted to provide an immersive
              and integrated experience for all players.

            <h3>PokeTwo AI Catcher</h3>
            <p>
              <bold>FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY</bold><br />
              It is a AI based bot that plays the game PokeTwo in discord. It
              uses the discord.py library to interact with the discord api and
              uses the tenserflow based ai model to predict pokemon images. It
              uses a simple algorithm to catch pokemons and sell them for money.
              It is a simple project to understand how to interact with the
              discord api and how to implement AI based image detection models.
              It's still underdevelopment, but i lost intrest in it and thus
              receives updates late.

            <h3>PhotoSpectroscope</h3>
            <p>
              The project involves real-time sectroscope analysis using a live
              video feed. The program captures video frames from a webcam and
              extracts spectral information, generating graphs of reflectance
              and transmittance. This tool can be used for various applications,
              including material analysis, chemical testing, and educational
              purposes. I used python and OpenCV to develop this project.

            <p>
              The project is a simple pomodoro timer that helps users manage
              time along with a todo list. It got spotify integration to play
              music while working and some vibrant video backgrounds to keep the
              user engaged. It is a simple project created with my friend Param,
              since we could not use custom background images or videos in
              exsisiting pomodoro apps, we decided to make our own. It is a
              simple project but it is very useful and has a lot of features.

            <h3>File Sorter</h3>
            <p>
              The project is a simple UI based file sorter that sorts files
              according to their type. It is a simple project that i made to
              learn how to make UI based applications in python. It allows you
              to specify a directory, file extensions, and an optional log file
              for tracking file movements. The program then sorts the files into
              folders based on their extensions. It is a simple project but it
              is very useful and has a lot of features.
